### Dataset(s)
Two datasets, fraudTrain.csv and fraudTest.csv, were downloaded from Kaggle. These files contain records of simulated financial transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.
For this project, both datasets were combined into a single dataset to:
- Increase the training sample size, which improves model learning and robustness.
- Enable a custom train-test split, allowing more control over model validation.
- Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) across the full dataset to identify trends, outliers, and fraud-related patterns that may otherwise be missed in a smaller sample.

#### Data Source: 
The dataset used in this project was downloaded from [Kaggle â€“ Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1).
Due to file size limitations, the raw CSV files (fraudTrain.csv and fraudTest.csv) are not included in this repository.

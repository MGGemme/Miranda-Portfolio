### Dataset(s)
Two datasets were downloaded from Kaggle (link below). One was fraudTrain and the other was fraudTest. These two csv files will be combined to improve the models training quality and so I can conduct my own train-test split. Additionally I would like to conduct a full EDA on the entire dataset in order to discover patterns 


Two datasets, fraudTrain.csv and fraudTest.csv, were downloaded from Kaggle. These files contain records of simulated financial transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.
For this project, both datasets were combined into a single dataset to:
- Increase the training sample size, which improves model learning and robustness.
- Enable a custom train-test split, allowing more control over model validation.
- Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) across the full dataset to identify trends, outliers, and fraud-related patterns that may otherwise be missed in a smaller sample.

## About Me

Hi! I’m Miranda and I have a background in public health, pharmacy, and applied machine learning. I enjoy working on real-world problems where I can use data to make things more efficient and understandable.

Most of my work is done in R and Python, but I also use SQL, Tableau, and any other tools required by the project. I’m a quick learner and always open to learning new skills or technologies when the project calls for it.

I’m based in Massachusetts but open to remote work or relocating to Florida, South Carolina, or North Carolina. I’m also comfortable collaborating with teams or working independently.

Thanks for checking out my work!
